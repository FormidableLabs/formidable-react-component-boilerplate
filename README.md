#Component Boilerplate

Formidable Labs flavored react component boilerplate.  This is a set of opinions on how to start a react component.  We expect these opinions to change *often*.  We've written a yeoman generator to pull down the freshest copy of this repo whenever you use it.  It just copies this repo so you don't have to. Check it out [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/generator-formidable-react-component)

## Run the demo
```
gulp 
```

## Make it yours!
The top level component in this boilerplate repo is called `BoilerplateComponent`. You probably want to change that. Remember to update `index.js` to reflect your naming changes!  

## When releasing 
remember to `gulp build` and commit the built `lib` directory before releasing.
