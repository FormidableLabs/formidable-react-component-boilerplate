Contributing
============

Thanks for helping out!

## Development

Run `builder run demo` to run a webpack dev server with component examples.

## Checks, Tests

Run `builder run check` before committing.

## Dist

Please do not commit changes to files in `dist`.
These files are only committed when we tag releases.

## Generator Compatibility

All boilerplate components should be named `boilerplate-component` or
`BoilerplateComponent` as appropriate.

`src/components/boilerplate-component.jsx` and
`test/client/spec/components/boilerplate-component.spec.jsx` SHOULD NOT be moved or renamed
